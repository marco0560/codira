# AGENTS.md — codira Repository Contract

## 0. Mission

You are operating on the codira repository.

Priority order:

1. Correctness
2. Test integrity (authoritative behavior)
3. Reproducibility
4. Traceability
5. Minimality of change

Fluency is irrelevant.

## 1. Operating Mode

Mode: HARD-FAIL DETERMINISTIC

Rules:

- Never guess
- Never infer missing code
- Never reconstruct unseen files
- Never approximate behavior

If required information is missing:

-> STOP
-> Ask for clarification

## 2. Sources of Truth (SOT)

Priority order:

1. Repository files (filesystem)
2. Tests (`tests/`) -> authoritative behavior contract
3. Project documentation (`docs/`)
4. User instructions

Previous assistant output is NOT a source of truth.

If something is not visible -> STOP.

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Determinism

All outputs must be:

- reproducible
- verifiable
- minimal

No “best effort”.

### 3.2 Minimalism (LEAN)

- Prefer the smallest correct solution
- Avoid premature abstraction
- Do not introduce frameworks or patterns unless required

### 3.3 Scope Control

Strictly limit changes to the requested task.

Forbidden unless explicitly required:

- Refactoring unrelated code
- Renaming symbols
- API changes
- Stylistic churn

If a change risks unintended impact:

-> STOP
-> Ask for clarification

## 4. Repository-Specific Constraints

These constraints define the **real behavior surface** of the system.

- CLI behavior and output format are stability contracts
- Configuration and preflight behavior are part of the user-facing contract
- Deterministic output is required across environments
- Optional features must remain optional
- Performance regressions are considered bugs
- Changes must not silently alter user-visible behavior

If a change affects any of the above:

-> Treat as high risk
-> Validate explicitly

## 5. Execution Workflow (MANDATORY)

For any non-trivial task:

1. Analyze request
2. Identify missing information
3. Ask clarification questions if needed
4. Propose a concrete plan
5. WAIT for approval
6. Execute the plan
7. Validate (Section 8)
8. Ensure behavioral correctness (tests)
9. Produce commit block (if applicable)

Do NOT skip steps.

When the task is non-trivial and the planning phase is ambiguous, underconstrained, or has multiple viable approaches, use `planning-refinement-gate` before producing the concrete plan. Do not proceed to detailed planning until all required operator decisions are explicitly confirmed.

## 6. Deterministic Exploration

Before modifying code:

1. Verify symbols:

    ```bash
    rg <query>
    ```

2. Use repository tools when available (index/context systems)
3. Read actual source files before editing

Never modify code based only on assumptions.

## 7. Change Strategy

- Prefer multiple small commits over large changes
- Limit changes to one subsystem when possible
- Decompose complex work into incremental steps
- Avoid mixing refactor, feature, and bugfix in a single change

## 8. Validation Contract

All required checks MUST pass before concluding.

Preferred:

```bash
python scripts/validate_repo.py
```

Repository Python tooling MUST be run through `scripts/validate_repo.py` or
`scripts/run_repo_tool.py`. Do not set `PRE_COMMIT_HOME`, `RUFF_CACHE_DIR`,
`TMP`, `TEMP`, `TMPDIR`, pytest `--basetemp`, or pytest cache paths to
repository-local directories. The repository wrapper routes cache and temporary
state outside the checkout and prevents undeletable tool-state directories from
polluting the worktree.

Fallback:

```bash
python scripts/run_repo_tool.py black --check .
python scripts/run_repo_tool.py ruff check .
python scripts/run_repo_tool.py mypy .
python scripts/run_repo_tool.py pytest -q tests
```

Rules:

- Fix all failures BEFORE concluding
- Do not ignore warnings/errors
- Do not weaken tests to pass validation

## 8.1 Toolchain Execution Model

All repository tooling MUST be executed through:

- `scripts/validate_repo.py`
- `scripts/run_repo_tool.py`

Direct invocation of tools (ruff, mypy, pytest, black) is forbidden unless explicitly required.

Rationale:

- isolates environment
- prevents cache pollution
- ensures reproducibility

## 9. Targeted Validation

- Identify affected subsystems
- Run focused tests first (fast feedback)
- Run full test suite before commit

## 10. Test Contract

Tests are the authoritative behavioral specification.

Requirements:

- Deterministic
- Environment-independent
- No reliance on external systems unless explicitly allowed

Forbidden:

- Weakening assertions
- Introducing flakiness
- Bypassing failing tests

If tests contradict assumptions -> tests win.

## 11. Strict Patch Discipline

All code changes MUST be provided as:

- explicit file paths
- exact OLD block (byte-identical)
- exact NEW block

Rules:

- No summaries
- No partial edits
- No reconstructed context
- No “approximate matches”

If OLD block cannot be matched exactly -> STOP.

## 12. Architecture Constraints

Respect separation of concerns.

Example pattern:

| Layer      | Responsibility        |
|------------|-------------------- --|
| scanner    | filesystem -> symbols |
| indexer    | symbols -> database   |
| query      | database -> results   |
| CLI        | user interface        |

Rules:

- Do not mix layers
- Do not bypass abstractions
- Do not duplicate existing logic

## 13. Build System & Generated Artifacts

- Keep build configuration and outputs in sync
- Do not manually edit generated files
- Modify generators and regenerate outputs instead
- Treat build or packaging regressions as real bugs

## 14. Coding Standards

### Python

- Type hints required
- Avoid `Any` unless justified
- Prefer `Path` over string paths

### Docstrings

Use NumPy style.

Required for:

- modules
- classes
- non-trivial functions

Must include:

- Parameters
- Returns

Include when applicable:

- Raises
- Notes
- Examples

Docstrings must reflect actual behavior (no drift).

## 15. Error Handling

- Fail fast
- Catch only expected exceptions
- Avoid broad `except Exception`

## 16. Regression Policy

The following are considered bugs:

- platform-specific breakages
- optional feature regressions
- performance regressions
- CLI or output contract changes

## 17. Debugging Discipline

- Reproduce the issue before fixing
- Identify root cause before writing code
- Avoid speculative fixes

## 18. Hidden Complexity Rule

If code appears complex or redundant:

- Assume it encodes real edge cases
- Check history/tests before simplifying
- Do not “clean up” without proof

## 19. Commit Contract

If committing or proposing a commit:

- Use `commit-block-generator` if available
- Produce a **single atomic commit**

Commit message MUST:

- follow repository hook rules
- match format: `type(scope): summary`
- be CI-compliant

Commit body MUST include:

- root cause
- implemented fix
- validation performed (when applicable)

Do NOT include toolchain status lines.

## 20. Required Shared Skills

When available locally in ~/.codex/skills, MUST be used:

- `deterministic-change-workflow`
- `numpy-docstring-enforcer`
- `commit-block-generator`
- `codira-workflow`
- `planning-refinement-gate` for ambiguous or multi-option planning work
- repository-specific workflow tools

If unavailable:

-> state explicitly
-> apply rules manually

If a required skill is referenced but not available:

-> STOP
-> Report missing skill
-> Do not approximate its behavior

## 20.1. Codira Mandatory Exploration Rule

When the repository provides the `codira` tool, it MUST be used as the primary exploration mechanism.

This rule applies whenever the agent needs to:

- understand repository structure
- locate symbols or references
- analyze call relationships
- retrieve task-relevant context
- decide where to read or modify code

### Required behavior

Before performing broad file reading, recursive browsing, or generic search:

1. Activate the environment.
2. Run:

   codira index

3. Use `codira` queries to narrow the search space:

   - symbol lookup: codira sym ...
   - call graph: codira calls ...
   - references: codira refs ...
   - semantic retrieval: codira emb ...
   - contextual retrieval: codira ctx ...

4. Only after narrowing the scope:
   - read specific files
   - inspect code in detail

### Forbidden behavior

The following are NOT allowed as first steps when `codira` is available:

- reading large portions of the repository blindly
- scanning directories without a prior indexed query
- relying solely on text search (`rg`) for initial discovery

### Fallback

If and only if:

- `codira index` fails, OR
- results are demonstrably insufficient

then fallback to:

- `rg`
- manual file inspection

### Enforcement

If `codira` is available and this rule is not followed:

→ STOP
→ report violation
→ restart using `codira-workflow`

## 21. Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)

- Guessing missing code
- Blind filesystem scanning when structured tools exist
- Re-implementing existing logic
- Introducing caching without clear invalidation
- Silent failures
- Skipping validation
- Modifying unrelated code

## 22. Session Stability

Continuously monitor for:

- context drift
- assumption creep
- loss of file grounding

If detected:

-> STOP
-> Recommend RESET

## 23. Engineering Heuristics

- Small changes can have wide effects
- Complex code often encodes edge cases
- Prefer correctness over elegance
- Validate changes beyond the immediate scope
- When duplication spreads, extract shared logic

## 24. When in Doubt

STOP and ask for clarification.

Never proceed with assumptions.

## 25. Future Extensions

This contract may evolve to include:

- release workflows
- audit procedures
- indexing/retrieval policies
